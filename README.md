# Statistical-Arbitrage
Statistical arbitrage trading or pairs trading as it is commonly known is defined as trading one financial instrument or a basket of financial instruments – in most cases to create a value neutral basket.
It is the idea that a co-integrated pair is mean reverting in nature. There is a spread between the instruments and the further it deviates from its mean, the greater the probability of a reversal.
Note however that statistical arbitrage is not a risk free strategy. Say for example that you have entered positions for a pair and then the spread picks up a trend rather than mean reverting.
